\#Problem 1 \* Create a data frame comprised of: \* a random sample of
size 10 from a standard Normal distribution \* a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 \* a
character vector of length 10 \* a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

``` r
##Frame
set.seed(1)

P1_df = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  sample_logical = c(random_sample > 0),
  character_vector= c("circle","quadrangle","Triangular","rectangle","trapezoid", "square","oval","conical","hexagon","Egg-Shaped"),
  factor_vector= factor(c("S", "S","S","M", "M","M", "L","L","L","L"))
)
```

``` r
##Mean
mean(pull(P1_df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.1322028

``` r
mean(pull(P1_df, sample_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(P1_df, character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(P1_df, character_vector)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(P1_df, factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(P1_df, factor_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

\*\* In this case, I could not get the mean of character\_vector and
factor\_vector since they are not numeric or logical.\*\*

``` r
##By using as.numeric function to convert
as.numeric(pull(P1_df, sample_logical))
```

    ##  [1] 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0

``` r
as.numeric(pull(P1_df, character_vector))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(P1_df, factor_vector))
```

    ##  [1] 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1

\*\* In this case, it can be see that logical and factor could convert
variables to numerical variable and the character can not convert to
numerical variable.\*\*

``` r
##Converting
as.numeric(as.factor(P1_df$character_vector))
```

    ##  [1]  1  6 10  7  9  8  5  2  4  3

\*\* In this case, it can be see that the character can be convert to
numerical.\*\*

\#Problem 2 \* This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting,
and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types. \*\*install
a package containing the penguins dataset.

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
```

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Write a short description of the penguins dataset (not the penguins\_raw
dataset) using inline R code, including: \* the data in this dataset,
including names / values of important variables \* the size of the
dataset (using nrow and ncol) \* the mean flipper length
